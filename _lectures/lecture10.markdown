title: "Constraint-Based Analysis"
description: |
  In this module, you’ll learn about Constraint-Based Analysis, a popular approach to program analysis, and its benefits over the approaches studied earlier. You’ll learn a constraint language called Datalog and how it is used to specify intra-procedural and inter-procedural dataflow analyses. The module will also describe tradeoffs made in context-insensitive and context-sensitive inter-procedural analysis. In the end, you’ll learn about other constraint languages, SAT and SMT, and their applications to program analysis.
